\arguments{
\item{Pedigree}{dataframe with columns id-dam-sire. May include
non-genotyped individuals, which will be treated as dummy individuals. If
provided, any pedigree in \code{SeqList} is ignored.}

\item{GenoM}{numeric matrix with genotype data: One row per individual, and
one column per SNP, coded as 0, 1, 2 or -9 (missing). See also
\code{\link{GenoConvert}}.}

\item{CalcLLR}{calculate log-likelihood ratios for all assigned parents
(genotyped + dummy/non-genotyped; parent vs. otherwise related). If
\strong{\code{FALSE}}, only number of mismatching SNPs are counted (OH &
ME), and parameters \code{LifeHistData}, \code{AgePrior}, \code{Err},
\code{Tassign}, and \code{Complex} are \strong{ignored}. Note also that
calculating likelihood ratios is much more time consuming than counting OH
& ME.}

\item{LifeHistData}{dataframe with 3 columns (optionally 5):
 \describe{
 \item{ID}{max. 30 characters long}
 \item{Sex}{1 = female, 2 = male, 3 = unknown, 4 = hermaphrodite,
           other numbers or NA = unknown}
\item{BirthYear }{birth or hatching year, integer, with missing values as NA
  or any negative value.}
\item{BY.min}{minimum birth year, only used if BirthYear is missing}
\item{BY.max}{maximum birth year, only used if BirthYear is missing} }
If the species has multiple generations per year, use an integer coding such
that the candidate parents' `Birth year' is at least one smaller than their
putative offspring's. Column names are ignored, so ensure column order is ID
- sex - birth year (- BY.min - BY.max). Individuals do not need to be in the
same order as in `GenoM', nor do all genotyped individuals need to be
included.}

\item{AgePrior}{logical (\code{TRUE/FALSE}) whether to estimate the ageprior
from \code{Pedigree} and \code{LifeHistData}, or a matrix as generated by
\code{\link{MakeAgePrior}} and included in the \code{\link{sequoia}}
output. The \code{AgePrior} affects which relationships are considered
possible: only those where \eqn{P(A|R) / P(A) > 0}.  When \code{TRUE},
\code{\link{MakeAgePrior}} is called using its default values. When
\code{FALSE}, all relationships are considered possible for all age
differences, except that parent-offspring pairs cannot have age difference
zero, and grand-parental pairs have an age difference of at least two.}

\item{SeqList}{list with output from \code{\link{sequoia}}. If input
parameter \code{Pedigree=NULL}, \code{SeqList$Pedigree} will be used if
present, and \code{SeqList$PedigreePar} otherwise. If \code{SeqList$Specs}
is present, input parameters with the same name as its items are ignored,
except 'CalcLLR' and 'AgePriors=FALSE'. The list elements  `LifeHist',
`AgePriors', and `ErrM' are also used if present, and override the
corresponding input parameters.}

\item{Err}{estimated genotyping error rate, as a single number or 3x3 matrix.
Details below. The error rate is presumed constant across SNPs, and
missingness is presumed random with respect to actual genotype.}

\item{ErrFlavour}{function that takes \code{Err} (single number) as input,
and returns a 3x3 matrix of observed (columns) conditional on actual (rows)
genotypes, or choose from inbuilt options 'version2.0', 'version1.3', or
'version1.1', referring to the sequoia version in which they were the
default. Ignored if \code{Err} is a matrix. See \code{\link{ErrToM}}.}

\item{Tassign}{minimum LLR required for acceptance of proposed relationship,
relative to next most likely relationship. Higher values result in more
conservative assignments. Must be zero or positive.}

\item{Tfilter}{threshold log10-likelihood ratio (LLR) between a proposed
relationship versus unrelated, to select candidate relatives. Typically a
negative value, related to the fact that unconditional likelihoods are
calculated during the filtering steps. More negative values may decrease
non-assignment, but will increase computational time.}

\item{Complex}{Breeding system complexity. Either "full" (default), "simp"
(simplified, no explicit consideration of inbred relationships), "mono"
(monogamous).}

\item{Herm}{Hermaphrodites, either "no", "A" (distinguish between dam and
sire role, default if at least 1 individual with sex=4), or "B" (no
distinction between dam and sire role). Both of the latter deal with
selfing.}

\item{quiet}{logical, suppress messages}
}
\value{
The \code{Pedigree} dataframe with additional columns:
 \item{LLRdam}{Log10-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) of this female being the mother,
 versus the next most likely relationship between the focal individual and
 this female (see Details for relationships considered)}
 \item{LLRsire}{idem, for male parent}
 \item{LLRpair}{LLR for the parental pair, versus the next most likely
  configuration between the three individuals (with one or neither parent
  assigned)}
 \item{OHdam}{Number of loci at which the offspring and mother are
   opposite homozygotes}
 \item{OHsire}{idem, for father}
 \item{MEpair}{Number of Mendelian errors between the offspring and the
   parent pair, includes OH as well as e.g. parents being opposing
   homozygotes, but the offspring not being a heterozygote. The offspring
   being OH with both parents is counted as 2 errors.}
 \item{SNPd.id}{Number of SNPs scored (non-missing) for the focal individual}
 \item{SNPd.id.dam}{Number of SNPs scored (non-missing) for both individual
   and dam}
 \item{SNPd.id.sire}{Number of SNPs scored for both individual and sire}
 \item{Sexx}{Sex in LifeHistData, or inferred Sex when assigned as part of
   parent-pair}
 \item{BY.est}{mode of birth year probability distribution}
 \item{BY.lo}{lower limit of 95\% highest density region of birth year
 probability distribution}
 \item{BY.hi}{higher limit}

The columns 'LLRdam', 'LLRsire' and 'LLRpair' are only included when
\code{CalcLLR=TRUE}. When a parent or parent-pair is incompatible with the
lifehistory data or presumed genotyping error rate, the error value '777' may
be given.

The columns 'Sexx', 'BY.est', 'BY.lo' and 'BY.hi' are only included when
\code{LifeHistData} is provided, and at least one genotyped individual has an
unknown birth year or unknown sex.
}
\description{
Count opposite homozygous (OH) loci between parent-offspring
  pairs and Mendelian errors (ME) between parent-parent-offspring trios, and
  calculate the parental log-likelihood ratios (LLR). Also returns estimate
  of actual genotypes.
}
\details{
Any individual in \code{Pedigree} that does not occur in
  \code{GenoM} is substituted by a dummy individual; these can be recognised
  by the value 0' in columns 'SNPd.id.dam' and `SNPd.id.sire` in the output.
  For non-genotyped individuals the parental log-likelihood ratio can be
  calculated if they have at least one genotyped offspring (see also
  \code{\link{getAssignCat}}).

  The birth years in \code{LifeHistData} and the \code{AgePrior} are not used
  in the calculation and do not affect the value of the likelihoods for the
  various relationships, but they _are_ used during some filtering steps, and
  may therefore affect the likelihood _ratio_. The default
  (\code{AgePrior=FALSE}) assumes all age-relationship combinations are
  possible, which may mean that some additional alternatives are considered
  compared to the \code{\link{sequoia}} default, resulting in somewhat lower
  \code{LLR} values.

  A negative LLR for A's parent B indicates either that B is not truely the
  parent of A, or that B's parents are incorrect. The latter may cause B's
  presumed true, unobserved genotype to divert from its observed genotype,
  with downstream consequences for its offspring. In rare cases it may also
  be due to 'weird', non-implemented double or triple relationships between A
  and B.
