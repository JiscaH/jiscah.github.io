\title{transform log-likelihoods to probabilities}
\usage{
LLtoProb(LLv)
}
\arguments{
\item{LLv}{a vector with log10-likelihoods. All values >0 are set to NA.}
}
\value{
a vector with probabilities, with the same length and names.
}
\description{
transform a vector with log10 likelihoods to a vector with
 probabilities summing to one.

 @details The returned probabilities are calculated from the likelihoods used
  throughout the rest of this package, by scaling them to sum to one across
  all possible relationships. For \code{Complex='simp'} these are
  PO=parent-offspring, FS=full siblings, HS=half siblings, GP=grand-parental,
  FA=full avuncular, HA=third degree relatives (incl half avuncular), and
U=unrelated. For \code{Complex='full'} there are numerous double relationship
  considered (PO & HS, HS & HA, etc), making both numerator and denominator
  in the scaling step less unambiguous, and the returned probabilities an
  approximation.

 Computational under/overflow issues are reduced by subtracted the
  maximum value before converting from log to regular scale. Probabilities
  that would still be smaller than the machine precision (\code{(LL -
  min(LL)/2) < log10(.Machine$double.xmin)}) are set to NA en then to 0,
  instead of \code{-Inf}, to avoid issues when scaling to sum to 1.

LL_pairs <- CalcPairLL(data.frame(ID1='i042_2003_F',
                         ID2=c('i015_2001_F', 'i022_2002_F', 'i035_2002_F')),
                  GenoM = Geno_griffin, Complex='simp', Err=1e-3, Plot=FALSE)
prob_pairs <- plyr::aaply(as.matrix(LL_pairs[,10:16]), .margin=1, LLtoProb)
round(prob_pairs, 3)
# i035_2002_F is MHS of i042_2003_F, but when not conditioning on any other
# relatives has a higher LL to be 3rd degree relative (HA)
# (possibly genotyping errors, or just randomness of Mendelian inheritance)
