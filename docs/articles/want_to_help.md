# Want to help?

Everyone who reports a bug is contributing to improve `sequoia`, and
these contributions are much appreciated!

If you have ideas or suggestions for new or improved functions, and/or
wish to contribute to `sequoia`, or collaborate in some other way,
please do contact me :-).

One low-effort way may for example be to share any ‘sequoia-adjacent
functions’ on [github](https://github.com/JiscaH/sequoiaExtra).
