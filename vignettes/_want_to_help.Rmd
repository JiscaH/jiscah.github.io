Everyone who reports a bug is contributing to improve `sequoia`, and these contributions are much appreciated!

If you have ideas or suggestions for new or improved functions, and/or wish to contribute to `sequoia`, or collaborate in some other way, please do contact me :-). 

One low-effort way may for example be to share any 'sequoia-adjacent functions' on [github](https://github.com/JiscaH/sequoiaExtra).

### Donate
`sequoia` was initially developped while I was employed by the [Rum red deer project](http://rumdeer.biology.ed.ac.uk/) at the University of Edinburgh, but a
 substantial part was written in my own time. And although I thoroughly enjoy helping people to reconstruct pedigrees for an amazing range of species, user support can be quite time consuming. 

I very much wish `sequoia` to remain free to use for everyone, as some users are likely to have very limited budgets, e.g. those working in conservation. But if you do have the financial means, a donation via [] would be greatly appreciated.
