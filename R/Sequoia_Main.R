#' @title Pedigree Reconstruction
#'
#' @description Perform pedigree reconstruction based on SNP data, including
#'   parentage assignment and sibship clustering.
#'
#' @details For each pair of candidate relatives, the likelihoods are calculated
#'   of them being parent-offspring (PO), full siblings (FS), half siblings
#'   (HS), grandparent-grandoffspring (GG), full avuncular (niece/nephew -
#'   aunt/uncle; FA), half avuncular/great-grandparental/cousins (HA), or
#'   unrelated (U). Assignments are made if the likelihood ratio (LLR) between
#'   the focal relationship and the most likely alternative exceed the threshold
#'   Tassign.
#'
#'   Dummy parents of sibships are denoted by F0001, F0002, ... (mothers)
#'   and M0001, M0002, ... (fathers), are appended to the bottom of the
#'   pedigree, and may have been assigned real or dummy parents themselves (i.e.
#'   sibship-grandparents). A dummy parent is not assigned to singletons.
#'
#'   Full explanation of the various options and interpretation of the output is
#'   provided in the vignettes and on the package website,
#'   https://jiscah.github.io/index.html .
#'
#' @param GenoM  numeric matrix with genotype data: One row per individual, and
#'   one column per SNP, coded as 0, 1, 2 or -9 (missing). See also
#'   \code{\link{GenoConvert}}.
#' @param LifeHistData data.frame with up to 6 columns:
#'  \describe{
#'  \item{ID}{max. 30 characters long}
#'  \item{Sex}{1 = female, 2 = male, 3 = unknown, 4 = hermaphrodite,
#'            other numbers or NA = unknown}
#' \item{BirthYear }{birth or hatching year, integer, with missing values as NA
#'   or any negative number.}
#' \item{BY.min}{minimum birth year, only used if BirthYear is missing}
#' \item{BY.max}{maximum birth year, only used if BirthYear is missing}
#' \item{Year.last}{Last year in which individual could have had offspring. Can
#'   e.g. in mammals be the year before death for females, and year after death
#'   for males. } }
#' "Birth year" may be in any arbitrary discrete time unit relevant to the
#' species (day, month, decade), as long as parents are never born in the same
#' time unit as their offspring, and only integers are used. Individuals do not
#' need to be in the same order as in `GenoM', nor do all genotyped individuals
#' need to be included.
#' @param SeqList list with output from a previous run, to be re-used in the
#'   current run. Used are elements `PedigreePar', `LifeHist', `AgePriors',
#'   `Specs', and `ErrM', and these override the corresponding input parameters.
#'   Not all of these elements need to be present, and all other elements are
#'   ignored. If \code{SeqList$Specs} is provided, all  input parameters with
#'   the same name as its items are ignored, except
#'   \code{Module}/\code{MaxSibIter}.
#' @param Module one of
#'   \describe{
#'     \item{pre}{Only input check, return \code{SeqList$Specs}}
#'     \item{dup}{Also check for duplicate genotypes}
#'     \item{par}{Also perform parentage assignment (genotyped parents to
#'       genotyped offspring)}
#'     \item{ped}{(Also) perform full pedigree reconstruction, including
#'       sibship clustering and grandparent assignment. By far the most time
#'       consuming, and may take several hours for large datasets.}
#'   }
#'   NOTE: \emph{Until `MaxSibIter` is fully deprecated: if `MaxSibIter` differs
#'   from the default (\code{42}), and `Module` equals the default
#'   (\code{'ped'}), MaxSibIter overrides `Module`.}
#' @param Err estimated genotyping error rate, as a single number, length 3
#'   vector or 3x3 matrix; see details below. The error rate is presumed
#'   constant across SNPs, and missingness is presumed random with respect to
#'   actual genotype. Using \code{Err} >5\% is not recommended.
#' @param Tfilter threshold log10-likelihood ratio (LLR) between a proposed
#'   relationship versus unrelated, to select candidate relatives. Typically a
#'   negative value, related to the fact that unconditional likelihoods are
#'   calculated during the filtering steps. More negative values may decrease
#'   non-assignment, but will increase computational time.
#' @param Tassign minimum LLR required for acceptance of proposed relationship,
#'   relative to next most likely relationship. Higher values result in more
#'   conservative assignments. Must be zero or positive.
#' @param MaxSibshipSize  maximum number of offspring for a single individual (a
#'   generous safety margin is advised).
#' @param DummyPrefix character vector of length 2 with prefixes for dummy dams
#'   (mothers) and sires (fathers); maximum 20 characters each. Length 3 vector
#'   in case of hermaphrodites (or default prefix 'H').
#' @param Complex  Breeding system complexity. Either "full" (default), "simp"
#'   (simplified, no explicit consideration of inbred relationships), "mono"
#'   (monogamous).
#' @param Herm  Hermaphrodites, either "no", "A" (distinguish between dam and
#'   sire role, default if at least 1 individual with sex=4), or "B" (no
#'   distinction between dam and sire role). Both of the latter deal with
#'   selfing.
#' @param UseAge  either "yes" (default), "no" (only use age differences for
#'   filtering), or "extra" (additional rounds with extra reliance on ageprior,
#'   may boost assignments but increased risk of erroneous assignments). Used
#'   during full reconstruction only.
#' @param args.AP list with arguments to be passed on to
#'   \code{\link{MakeAgePrior}}, e.g. `Discrete` (non-overlapping generations),
#'   `MinAgeParent`, `MaxAgeParent`.
#' @param mtSame  \strong{NEW} matrix indicating whether individuals (might)
#'   have the same mitochondrial haplotype (1), and may thus be matrilineal
#'   relatives, or not (0). Row names and column names should match IDs in
#'   `GenoM`. Not all individuals need to be included and order is not
#'   important. Please report any issues. For details see the mtDNA vignette.
#' @param CalcLLR  TRUE/FALSE; calculate log-likelihood ratios for all assigned
#'   parents (genotyped + dummy; parent vs. otherwise related). Time-consuming
#'   in large datasets. Can be done separately with \code{\link{CalcOHLLR}}.
#' @param quiet suppress messages: TRUE/FALSE/"verbose".
#' @param Plot display plots from \code{\link{SnpStats}, \link{MakeAgePrior}},
#'   and \code{\link{SummarySeq}}. Defaults (NULL) to TRUE when quiet=FALSE or
#'   "verbose", and FALSE when quiet=TRUE. If you get error 'figure margins too
#'   large', enlarge the plotting area (drag with mouse). Error 'invalid
#'   graphics state' can be dealt with by clearing the plotting area with
#'   dev.off().
#' @param StrictGenoCheck Automatically exclude any individuals genotyped for
#'   <5% of SNPs, and any SNPs genotyped for <5% of individuals (TRUE); this was
#'   the unavoidable default up to version 2.4.1. Otherwise only excluded are
#'   (very nearly) monomorphic SNPs, SNPs scored for fewer than 2 individuals,
#'   and individuals scored for fewer than 2 SNPs.
#' @param ErrFlavour \strong{DEPRECATED, (use length 3 vector for \code{Err}
#'   instead)} function that takes \code{Err} (single number) as input, and
#'   returns a 3x3 matrix of observed (columns) conditional on actual (rows)
#'   genotypes, or choose from inbuilt options 'version2.0', 'version1.3', or
#'   'version1.1', referring to the sequoia version in which they were the
#'   default. Ignored if \code{Err} is a matrix. See \code{\link{ErrToM}}.
#' @param MaxSibIter \strong{DEPRECATED, use \code{Module}} number of iterations
#'   of sibship clustering, including assignment of grandparents to sibships and
#'   avuncular relationships between sibships. Clustering continues until
#'   convergence or until MaxSibIter is reached. Set to 0 for parentage
#'   assignment only.
#' @param MaxMismatch \strong{DEPRECATED AND IGNORED}. Now calculated
#'   automatically using \code{\link{CalcMaxMismatch}}.
#' @param FindMaybeRel \strong{DEPRECATED AND IGNORED}, advised to run
#'   \code{\link{GetMaybeRel}} separately.
#'
#'
#' @return A list with some or all of the following components, depending on
#'   \code{Module}. All input except \code{GenoM} is included in the output.
#' \item{AgePriors}{Matrix with age-difference based probability ratios for
#'   each relationship, used for full pedigree reconstruction; see
#'   \code{\link{MakeAgePrior}} for details. When running only parentage
#'   assignment (\code{Module="par"}) the returned AgePriors has been updated to
#'   incorporate the information of the assigned parents, and is ready for use
#'   during full pedigree reconstruction.}
#' \item{args.AP}{(input) arguments used to specify age prior matrix. If a

#' their sex, estimated birth year (point estimate, upper and lower bound of

#' offspring.}
#' \item{DupGenotype}{Dataframe, duplicated genotypes (with different IDs,
#'  duplicate IDs are not allowed). The specified number of maximum mismatches
#'   is used here too. Note that this dataframe may include pairs of closely
#'   related individuals, and monozygotic twins.}
#' \item{DupLifeHistID}{Dataframe, row numbers of duplicated IDs in life
#'   history dataframe. For convenience only, but may signal a problem. The
#'   first entry is used.}
#' \item{ErrM}{(input) Error matrix; probability of observed genotype (columns)
#'   conditional on actual genotype (rows)}
#' \item{ExcludedInd}{Individuals in GenoM which were excluded because of a
#'   too low genotyping success rate (<50\%).}
#' \item{ExcludedSNPs}{Column numbers of SNPs in GenoM which were excluded
#'   because of a too low genotyping success rate (<10\%).}
#' \item{LifeHist}{(input) Dataframe with sex and birth year data. All missing

#' assigned as part of parent-pair), 'BY.est' (mode of birth year probability
#' distribution), 'BY.lo' (lower limit of 95\% highest density region), 'BY.hi'
#' (higher limit), inferred after parentage assignment. 'BY.est' is NA when the

#' \item{PedigreePar}{Dataframe with assigned parents from Parentage step.}
#' \item{Specs}{Named vector with parameter values.}
#' \item{TotLikParents}{Numeric vector, Total likelihood of the genotype data
#'   at initiation and after each iteration during Parentage.}
#' \item{TotLikSib}{Numeric vector, Total likelihood of the genotype data
#'   at initiation and after each iteration during Sibship clustering.}
#' \item{AgePriorExtra}{As AgePriors, but including columns for grandparents

#'  as used during the run.}
#' \item{DummyClones}{Hermaphrodites only: female-male dummy ID pairs that refer
#'   to the same non-genotyped individual}
#'
#' List elements PedigreePar and Pedigree both have the following columns:
#'  \item{id}{Individual ID}
#'  \item{dam}{Assigned mother, or NA}
#'  \item{sire}{Assigned father, or NA}
#'  \item{LLRdam}{Log10-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) of this female being the mother,
#'  versus the next most likely relationship between the focal individual and
#'  this female. See Details below for relationships considered, and see
#'  \code{\link{CalcPairLL}} for underlying likelihood values and further
#'  details)}
#'  \item{LLRsire}{idem, for male parent}
#'  \item{LLRpair}{LLR for the parental pair, versus the next most likely
#'   configuration between the three individuals (with one or neither parent
#'   assigned)}
#'  \item{OHdam}{Number of loci at which the offspring and mother are
#'    opposite homozygotes}
#'  \item{OHsire}{idem, for father}
#'  \item{MEpair}{Number of Mendelian errors between the offspring and the
#'    parent pair, includes OH as well as e.g. parents being opposing
#'    homozygotes, but the offspring not being a heterozygote. The offspring
#'    being OH with both parents is counted as 2 errors.}
#'
#'
#' @section Genotyping error rate:
#'   The genotyping error rate \code{Err} can be specified three different ways:
#'   \itemize{
#'    \item A single number, which is combined with \code{ErrFlavour} to create
#'   a 3x3 matrix with the probabilities of observed genotype (columns)
#'   conditional on actual genotype (rows). By default (\code{ErrFlavour} =
#'   'version2.0'), \code{Err} is interpreted as the locus level error rate (as
#'   opposed to allele level), e.g. the probability to observe a true
#'   heterozygote \emph{Aa} as \emph{aa} (het -> hom) = the probability to
#'   observe it as \emph{AA} \eqn{=E/2}. See \code{\link{ErrToM}} for details
#'   and examples.
#'   \item a 3x3 matrix, with the probabilities of observed genotype (columns)
#'   conditional on actual genotype (rows)
#'   \item a length 3 vector, with the probabilities to observe a actual
#'   homozygote as the other homozygote, to observe a homozygote as
#'   heterozygote, and to observe an actual heterozygote as homozygote (NEW from
#'   version 2.6). This only assumes that the two alleles are equivalent with
#'   respect to genotyping errors, i.e. $P(AA|aa) = P(aa|AA)$ and
#'   $P(aa|Aa)=P(AA|Aa)$.
#'   }
#'
#'
#' @section (Too) Few Assignments?:
#' Possibly \code{Err} is much lower than the actual genotyping error rate.
#'
#' Alternatively, a true parent will not be assigned when it is:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item unclear who is the parent and who the offspring, due to unknown birth
#'   year for one or both individuals
#'   \item unclear whether the parent is the father or mother
#'   \item unclear if it is a parent or e.g. full sibling or grandparent, due to
#'   insufficient genetic data
#'   }
#'  And true half-siblings will not be clustered when it is:
#'  \itemize{
#'    \item unclear if they are maternal or paternal half-siblings
#'    \item unclear if they are half-siblings, full avuncular, or grand-parental
#'    \item unclear what type of relatives they are due to insufficient genetic
#'    data
#'  }
#'  All pairs of non-assigned but likely/definitely relatives can be found with
#'  \code{\link{GetMaybeRel}}. For further information see the vignette.
